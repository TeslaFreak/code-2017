## EV2.11 Accumulator - Accumulator Management System
* The AMS must monitor all critical voltages and temperatures in the accumulator as well the integrity of all its voltage and temperature inputs. If an out-of-range or a malfunction is detected, it must shut down the electrical systems, open the AIRs and shut down the I.C. drive system within 60 seconds.7 (Some GLV systems may remain energized â€“ See Figure 34)
* The tractive system must remain disabled until manually reset by a person other than the driver. It must not be possible for the driver to re-activate the tractive system from within the car in case of an AMS fault.
